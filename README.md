# CS778: Foundations of Modern AI Course Project
This project centers on implementing core reinforcement-learning algorithms—Policy Gradient, TRPO, and PPO—and evaluating their behavior across five different Gym environments. It also explores a hybrid strategy for improving human alignment in large language models by combining Dueling Bandits with Direct Preference Optimization (DPO).
